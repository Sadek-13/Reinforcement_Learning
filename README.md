- Firsty agent observe the initial state of task and take decision based on it.

### →Types of Markov Decision Process
- Based on No. of actions and rewards:

- Based on Conditions:

## →Reward and Return
- Reward:
  Reward is the imidiate result of the action.
- Return:
  Return is the sum of reward which are obtain by an agent in a certain time untill the task is completed.

## →Discount Factor(γ)
The discount factor essentially determines how much the reinforcement learning agents cares about rewards in the distant future relative to those in the immediate future.

## →Policy(π)
Policy is a function that decides what action to take in a particular state.
- expression of policy:
